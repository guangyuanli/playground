Description

    Write an application that reports the CPU usage of all processes
    on the server (similar to 'top').  The application should listen
    on port 8845 for HTTP GET requests. When it gets a request for
    /cpu_usage, it should return a proper HTTP response containing the
    set of processes with their usage. Requests for any other resource
    should result in a 404 error. It is okay for the process data to
    be cached, but it should not be more than 1 second old. The information
    should be transmitted using a suitable data structure represented
    in JSON format. Please document the format of the response in the
    README file. The application can be written in the language of your
    choice.

Deliverables

    * Working code. 
    * README file with build and run instructions.
    * State your assumptions.
    * State how many hours it actually took you to complete your work.


Build
     * import source code to eclipse to compile. Default eclipse 3.8 (with CDT) setting should build it successfully

Dependency
     * Boost lib

Assumption and Limitation

     * For proving concept and implemenation convenience, assume the reasonable number of clients. There is no handling for large number of concurrent access.
     * only simulate top utility output in browser or other http client (not provided). 

Run:
     * After build successfully, go to debug dir and type:
     ./ http_server localhost (or other valid hostname)

Test:
     * open your browser to test against the server. HTTP request: http://localhost:8845/cpu_usage

Note:
      * Most of part of code are from boost lib.
